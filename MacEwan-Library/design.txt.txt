Website Description
____________________
	The MacEwan Library website is a space designed to help students
	find academic papers, journals, books, magazines, and other materials
	they might need for their learning. It also gives students access to
	research and citation help guides, and allows students to book rooms
	for study groups. The user's account keeps track of specific requests,
	fees owed to the library, and books currently signed out under that
	student's ID.

Major Changes
____________________
	General Layout:
		Currently the website is fairly well laid out. Students can navigate
		through with few problems, and though there is a lot of whitespace,
		the content is presented in a way that generally makes sense. They
		also keep the search bar available on all pages, which takes up a lot
		of space but is a good feature to have.

		The proposed layout attempts to utilize more of that whitespace, as
		well as limit some of the reoccurring links to specific locations.
		While many pages currently are presented nicely, some information is moved.
		Other pages are rearranged to make better use of the space and the information
		needed by the student. The navbar is also relocated to the left side of
		the page, rather than having it hanging off of the right. Additionally,
		items that can normally only be given to individuals registered with the
		school (such as booking private rooms) are only made visible after the
		user has signed in. Finally, while the main searchbar would ideally be more
		narrow than is presented either in my proposal or the actual website, it
		remains a useful feature.

	Student Account Layout:
		Currently, information about a student's item requests, rentals, or fees can
		be accessed on the student account page. Boxes are provided that, when needed,
		contain information about those items. A student's fees, and access to eReserves,
		are also shown under the search bar, around the middle of the page.

		The proposed changes just make better use of this space by organizing the
		contents a bit better, and adding a few more bits of information that a student
		might want. After logging in, the Room Booking option becomes available on the
		main navbar, and the option is also repeated on the page itself. Contents of the
		page are divided via items or rooms that a student has already reserved/are
		overdue, and items that a student has requested, have arrived, or wishes to
		request (such as an eReserve or the private rooms).

		Rather than having the website's main search bar appear on this page, a banner
		welcoming the student takes its place. On this banner users are also given access
		to their account history, which would show them the items they have borrowed in
		the past, as well as their current fees. This, combined with the new information
		suggested, will make finding account information easier for students.

	Subject Guide Layout:
		Currently the subject guide page is rather long, with all the available
		subject options being printed in a single column list. A side menu is made available
		on each page. This menu contains links to items a new student might not know how to
		access. Breadcrumbs appear above the page's content, which at this point just
		further breaks up the content.

		My proposed layout removes those breadcrumbs but keeps the sidebar, though the information
		could likely be found under either the Help or Research options in the main navbar. As
		a student using a subject guide might not know where to start, having these items
		easily accessible would be ok to have. The list is also compressed into a scrolling list,
		rather than taking up the bulk of the page.

	Database Search Layout:
		Along with a sidebar, this page gives several options for searching for a database. A
		user may search via title, type, subject, name, or they can make use of the long,
		multi-page list that this page also offers. Breadcrumbs are also available on this page.

		In my proposed layout the sidebar, which at this point just provides links back to
		Subject Guide and the Citation guide, is removed. I also removed the long multi-page
		list in favor of an alphabetical presentation. Ideally the tabs would be better spaced
		out, or at least larger, and there would be at least ten titles listed. This list is
		also scrollable.

	Citation Search Layout:
		Currently, this page contains the most whitespace so far. The same breadcrumbs and sidebar
		found in the Database Search page are found here, though the search form itself is a good
		idea. The biggest problem with it is the scale of the form, which takes approximately 20%
		of the space on the page in total.

		My proposal removes those unneeded breadcrumbs and sidebar contents, and makes the form
		the focus of the page. The search options are made larger, and the buttons to either clear
		or use the form are relocated to the top right of the search box. Ideally the search fields
		would probably be a little larger, but they would stay the focus of the page.
