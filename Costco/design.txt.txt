Website Description
____________________
	Costco Wholesale's website is a space designed to not only promote
	available product to the customer, but to give them access to special
	online-only content for delivery to their door. It contains a number of
	search options and allows the user to track their orders through their
	account, gives them access to special outside deals offered to Costco
	members, and provides access to other company-specific information.
	(ie. applying for jobs, information about the vendors, the Costco
	newsletter, etc.)
	

Major Changes
____________________
	General Layout:
		Currently the layout is dominated by showcased items with adds and
		member services mixed in. Hovering over the All Departments section
		of the navbar creates a dropdown menu, and hovering over those options
		creates yet another menu that obscures the entire page. The top of the
		page is filled with links, a logo, and a searchbar, and clicking the
		Business Center option sends the user to a different website with its
		own layout.

		The layout I propose adds more structure and makes the user's options more
		straightforward, as well as utilizes the whitespace on the page. Rather than
		a dropdown menu, a sidebar menu would appear and change contents as needed.
		Links at the top of the screen are condensed, the addspace is minimized
		and separated from the main content, and the searchbar is also relocated
		to the top of the screen. The Business Center link is relocated to the top
		of the screen and vanishes when a non-retailer logs into their account,
		and ideally the Business Center would contain the same layout.

	Navigation:
		Currently, navigation options are accessed via the dropdown menu on
		the All Departments button, and the other buttons on the navigation
		bar. Upon clicking an option, breadcrumbs appear above the page title,
		and more options appear as images on the screen. Further items can be
		accessed on the dropdown menu by hovering over text to open another
		menu, which cannot be used by touch devices as clicking on the option
		takes you to that page.

		The proposed layout removes the All Departments dropdown in favor of a
		sidebar menu of links. Breadcrumbs are still used, but the main navbar is
		altered to reflect these changes. The Business Center option has been
		removed from the main navbar, as it leads to a different website that most
		customers won't need, band is instead up at the top of the screen by the
		Sign In option. The Membership and Locations options are combined in the
		About Costco section, which should contain all the information you need to
		find and shop at a Costco.

	Showcased Items:
		Currently, the homescreen contains a large amount of showcased items (ie. ADS,
		more links that can be found through Services or Membership, links to some
		subsections in various departments, etc.) There is also a large banner that
		flips through even more showcased items. The options do get more focused further
		into the search, but these items still dominate the page.

		Proposed changes would include: Items/departments are still showcased in the center
		of the screen, but they are better separated to allow for less confusion by the
		typical user. More options to narrow down your search are available on the sidebar
		menu, breadcrumbs allow for easier navigation, and a Sort By option is provided on
		the showcased items as well.

	My Account:
		Currently the page offers a breadcrumb menu, a short sidebar menu, and pages with
		grouped text and dropdown menus.

		In my proposed changes, these dropdown menus would be simplified and display boxes
		would help keep content sorted nicely. The sidebar menu is stretched to create a
		better visual. The breadcrumbs are removed as the menu options are less complex,
		and all other sections of the website can be easily accessed through the Logo and
		the main navbar.
