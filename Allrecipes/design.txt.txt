Website Description
____________________
	Allrecipes is a website mostly used for searching, posting, and storing
	recipes. Users can search for recipes using a variety of methods, or they
	can upload their own recipes for public use. Users can also comment and
	rate recipes, change ingredient amounts, create a profile to store
	favorited recipes, and buy kitchen gear.

Major Changes
____________________
	General Layout:
		Currently Allrecipes focuses their layout on the presentation of their
		content, which is good! But it also hides some of the information a user
		might be looking for - such as finding a place to buy things, or specific
		types of cuisine. Posts are setup in a similar manner to Pinterest, and
		the user can enjoy endless scrolling on the main home page or search for
		something specific. If the user enters the shop, they are taken to a
		separate webpage with a different layout entirely. They use a large banner
		to showcase more items, their logo is minimized, and their menu contents
		can only be accessed through two dropdown menus. Adds are also hidden
		within the recipe posts.

		My proposal gives the logo a better highlight with it's social buttons along
		it's underside, as well as a dedicated addspace. I propose a different style
		for posts to give a 'recipe card' look, which contains an image, a short
		description, and some space for tags. There is also a dedicated space in a
		left sidebar that the user can use to search for recipes, search by
		ingredients, or search by a category. Lastly, a navbar is added to make
		general website navigation easier for the user, but keep the Bell, Like, and
		Profile buttons at the top.

	Search by Category:
		Currently this option only works via a dropdown menu, which is minimized
		beside the small logo at the top of the screen. When pressed, this menu
		expands and takes up roughly half the page, and breadcrumbs appear above
		the banner to help the user track their progress. Adds are also found
		throughout the posts.

		My proposal makes use of the sidebar and removes the breadcrumbs. To condense
		the information being presented, recipes are still presented in small posts,
		but they are stacked in a consistent layout rather than snapping together posts
		of differing sizes. Ideally, there would also be a total that could appear in
		one of three places: above the Find a Recipe search bar, above the addspace where
		there is currently a decent amount of whitespace, or on the actual page itself.

	Shop Layouts:
		Currently, clicking the Shop option leads the user to a separate website. This
		wouldn't be as big of a problem if the website weren't a completely different
		layout to the main website, and also require the user to click a small link at the
		top of the screen to return back to the "allrecipes Main Site". Content is organized
		similar to the main site's content, but with the addition of a navbar that contains
		dropdown menus. They also have a sidebar menu, and breadcrumbs.

		My proposed layout matches the shop layout to the recipes portion of the website.
		This, along with using the side menu, would help eliminate confusion for the user.
		The link to return the user back to the recipes would be placed on the navbar as a
		button, and navbar options become the shop options while the user is looking through
		their catalogue. Options are also limited a bit, as the current shop's sidebar contains
		more than nine different options to narrow down one's search. Ideally, there would be
		four, maybe five different options to narrow the focus of the search.

		As the user advances further through a particular search, the contents on the navbar
		change to match the contents being displayed. This refining process continues as the
		user searches, such as when searching for Knives in the Cutlery department, and the
		sidebar will also offer limitations, such as Under $20, or a min-max price option.
		Images can be enlarged when their respective box is selected.
